2. In the search box, type "insanity body transformation 60 days" and hit enter. You will see a list of results that match your query.
3. Look for the result that has the most seeders and leechers. Seeders are users who have the complete file and are sharing it with others. Leechers are users who are downloading the file but have not completed it yet. The more seeders and leechers a file has, the faster and more reliable the download will be.
4. Click on the magnet icon next to the result that you want to download. A magnet link is a URL that contains information about the file, such as its name, size, hash value, and trackers. A magnet link does not require you to download a separate torrent file.
5. Your torrent client will open automatically and ask you to confirm the download. Choose a location where you want to save the file and click OK.
6. Wait for the download to finish. Depending on your internet speed and the number of seeders and leechers available, this may take from minutes to hours.
7. Once the download is complete, you can open the file using your preferred media player or burn it to a DVD if you want.
